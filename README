This is what i use in my .Emacs 

Most of the code was not written by me. I have only done some customizations
and patches for known bugs in the packages.

If you find a bug or want to share your Emacs expertise to make my life
easier please contact me at diegoeche _ at _ gmail.com

All _MY_ code is licenced on a MIT basis whenever is applicable

Put everything in ~/
